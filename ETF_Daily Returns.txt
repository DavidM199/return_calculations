The .csv file has 20 rows and 2 columns and has information regarding the ticker symbol of 20 ETFs (Mostly traded north american corporate bond ETFs) and their focus (IG & HY).

The task is as follow:

1- Retrive the adjusted closed price data (2020-2023) for all ETFs using Yahoo Finance API.

2- Calculate daily returns:

	1- At each day-ETF observation, compute the ETF's daily returns for the next 20 days.
		
		
		Note1: daily returns for the 20 days means 20 returns for each day.
		e.g. :
			 return1  = (adj_closed_price_{t+1}  - adj_closed_price_{t}    ) / adj_closed_price_{t}
			 return2  = (adj_closed_price_{t+2}  - adj_closed_price_{t+1}  ) / adj_closed_price_{t+1}
			 ...
			 return20 = (adj_closed_price_{t+20} - adj_closed_price_{t+19} ) / adj_closed_price_{t + 19}
		
		Note2: Output can be any format that you like. I mention these as examples:
		One way to do so is to create 20 columns and store return of each day in one of the columns.
		Another way might to have a longer data.frame which have a columns named daa_return.
